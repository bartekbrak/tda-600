    I'll be honest with you, I spent too much time having fun learning React from scratch
    and now it's 3:49am. I won't write the unit tests.
    Arguably, there are no testable units in this code but I'm sure I can come up with some
    useless tests to prove that I can. Front unit tests would be much more desirable.
    Please accept this ASCII giraffe in apology.

    BTW, did you know that it's legal syntax for a function to have no body, and no pass, just the
    docstring, is fine? Yeah, me too.
